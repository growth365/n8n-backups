Firecrawl is amazing. Turn any website into LLM-ready data? Yes please. I just made a llms-full.txt of my website (all 80 blog posts! ðŸ¥µ) using a free account.\n\nI then threw that 250k token .txt file into Gemini for some analysis to...\n- review the ontology of my work and see the big picture\n- psychoanalyze myself (lol of course)\n\namazing, after that I was both feeling proud of myself (ðŸ¤©) and self-conscious of how obvious my psychological profile is from my published work (ðŸ˜…) so I figured I better make some real progress while I had all this data and an open chat with plenty of headroom in Gemini's sweet sweet 2m context window.\n\nSo I exported my google search console data for the past 3 months to add some analytical context to the content, and threw that into gemini too. Now we're up to ~300k tokens.\n\nI asked it to analyze my SEO and deliver a prioritized plan for improving my strategy.\n\nAnd not only did it give me a really thoughtful overview of my content map, it also was ready to give me an operational plan for improving the overall footprint, my linking strategies, etc. it also gave me some great non-obvious recommendations.\n\nFrankly, this has proven to be extremely effective. Just a year or two ago, this level of SEO analysis & strategic planning would easily have cost me a couple thousand bucks.\n\nBut now... I can do it for free with Claude Desktop + Firecrawl's MCP server, and Gemini 2.0 for 2M context window. \n\nNow... I just need to implement the 2 week plan it wrote for capitalizing on my top performing blogs it affectionately titled \"Stop The Bleeding\" lol, I appreciate Gemini's sense of urgency for improving my funnel.\n\nIt's a pity Squarespace is so poorly positioned for AI augmentation. I 100% have to move away from this platform to something that I can power agentically. \n\nI've thought about Ghost CMS, or building something myself with Lovable. But it's hard to prioritize that at the moment. It's a big lift to migrate a website to a new platform, even in this day and age. There's an opportunity in there somewhere for a hustler.\n\nAnyways, go play with Firecrawl. Well worth it.
